# DocBot+ : An Elisa like Prolog Chatbot
This is a chatbot called DocBot+ created using Prolog. It can converse and reply to general statements and queries, and can diagnose diseases like COVID and Cholera according to the user's symptoms.
<br>
This project is a part of my CS312 Artificial Intelligence Course.

<br>
Feel free to explore and improve the code, also try to find out some hidden easter eggs!
<br>
## Instructions to execute
